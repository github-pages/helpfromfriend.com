And then I've found <a href=\"http://j.mp/payperhost\" target=\"_blank\">Payperhost.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These guys claim to have a extensive experience with classic hosting solutions in Europe and they've decided to find a hole in the market and offer fast a cheap php hosting with pay as you go pricing. The hosting features are impressive - 2 locations (US and EU), both data &amp; database on SSD drives, PHP scripts pre-compiled and served from memory and of course automatic backups. And the best thing is very aggressive pricing - little websites like this one cost <strong>US$1 per month</strong> (yes your are reading correct!).</p>\n<p>They also offer reseller hosting with even better pricing and standard affiliate account with 20% fee. So if you are looking for fair and simple pricing with no hidden fees, <a href=\"http://j.mp/payperhost\" target=\"_blank\">give it a try</a>. We've moved all our wordpress sites there and we are not looking back...</p>\n",

Well - if you have original disc from Canon then you are fine. But in case you lost the disc or just bought used camera without original accessories then Canon prepared a terrible horror for you. The company has its application published on their web pages but there is one problem with it - the packages are called as \"Updaters\" and they can not be installed as standalone versions. You have to insert original CD from Canon prior to installing those updates and that's it. So if you lost your CD's, you have to contact Canon and re-buy copies of those (or get some friend and ask him for copies). Unbelievable, huh?</p>\n",

Then I found out one post mentioning <strong>blocked captcha</strong> for google account and after few secs I was <strong>able to sync</strong> my phone with google again.</p>\nAfter that I realized what actually happened. Some day I was trying to install Gmail client in my PDA and could not log into my account through it. It was still displaying index page with fields for user and password, after entering correct values it displayed error message stating that I entered bad username/password. I have tried it again for few times as I was pretty sure that credentials I am entering are correct - and then the client started to show also <strong>captcha field</strong> as usual. In that moment I gave up and close the client. I would never thought that this could be the reason for sync errors through the Exchange server, but it was! So what to do for fixing this? The solution si pretty easy but as usual, almost unknown to anyone.</p>\n<p>Got to <a title=\"Google Captcha Unlock\" href=\"https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha?\">Google Captcha </a><a title=\"Google Captcha Unlock\" href=\"https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha?\">Unlock</a> page (you can use your computer for that, it doesn't need to be done through blocked PDA) , simply enter your username, password and captcha text. If everything is correct, the page display message that the account was unlocked and you can try to run sync.</p>\n",

For Mozilla family browser you can defined special set of instructions which would modify user interface behaviour of your browser and also web pages. The instructions are stored in two separate files in user directory and names of the files are <em>userChrome.css</em> and <em>userContent.css</em> (you can read more about those on <a title=\"mozilla.org - Customizing Mozilla\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html\">official Mozilla</a> web site). We will be interested in <em>userContent.css</em>, which is used for modifying default behaviour of websites you visit.</p>\n<p>But first of all we need to find, where is this file stored. On Linux machines it should be in user home in .chrome directory (/home/username/.chrome). On Windows is the situation different with each version - for Windows XP is the best way to do <strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Run</strong> -&gt; type <strong>%APPDATA%</strong> and hit Enter. The folder with the application data will appear, go to Mozilla -&gt; Firefox -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Default profile directory -&gt; chrome. In here create a new file called userChrome.css and put there this content:</p>\n<pre class=\"css\">.entry-likers { display: none ! important; }</pre>\n<p>\nTry to reload Google Reader page to check if the annoying socials Like this anchors are still there - if so, restart the browser and enjoy socials free Reader!</p>\n",
