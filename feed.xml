                    <p>This week I was deciding where to migrate my wordpress sites as the current hosting at the <a href="https://www.appfog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appfog</a> is going to migrate to a new version of their platform which is not very well suited for our needs any more. There is hundreds and hundreds hosting solutions out there, some of them specialised purely on wordpress (ie. <strong>wordpress.com</strong>), some offering virtual machines (<strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>) or PaaS (as <strong>Appfog</strong> or <strong>Heroku</strong>).

There is hundreds and hundreds hosting solutions out there, some of them specialised purely on wordpress (ie. <strong>wordpress.com</strong>), some offering virtual machines (<strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>) or PaaS (as <strong>Appfog</strong> or <strong>Heroku</strong>). But I was after something fairly simple with little administration overhead and a with good pricetag. And then I've found <a href="http://j.mp/payperhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payperhost.com</a>.</p>

<p>These guys claim to have a extensive experience with classic hosting solutions in Europe and they've decided to find a hole in the market and offer fast a cheap php hosting with pay as you go pricing. The hosting features are impressive - 2 locations (US and EU), both data &amp; database on SSD drives, PHP scripts pre-compiled and served from memory and of course automatic backups. And the best thing is very aggressive pricing - little websites like this one cost <strong>US$1 per month</strong> (yes your are reading correct!).</p>
<p>They also offer reseller hosting with even better pricing and standard affiliate account with 20% fee. So if you are looking for fair and simple pricing with no hidden fees, <a href="http://j.mp/payperhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give it a try</a>. We've moved all our wordpress sites there and we are not looking back...</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install hpliphp-checkhp-doctor</pre>
<p>In case you see following error:</p>
<pre>Downloading plug-in from: error: Plugin download failed with error code = 8 error: file does not match its checksum. File may have been corrupted or altered</pre>
<p>You will need to install new drivers manually - download both <a title="hplip-3.15.2-plugin.run.asc" href="https://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/hplip-3.15.2-plugin.run.asc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hplip-3.15.2-plugin.run.asc</a> and <a title="hplip-3.15.2-plugin.run" href="https://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/hplip-3.15.2-plugin.run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hplip-3.15.2-plugin.run</a> files from the url below and put them into new directory.

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Recently I've bought a new laser printer from HP and I started to use XSane for scanning - unfortunately the program produces .pnm file for every scanned page and even though these are quite big and pretty much useless for attaching to emails and so. I've come up with following solution which works for me:</p>
<p>You will need ImageMagick and GhostScript (but very probable you have them both already installed) - if not:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install imagemagicksudo apt-get install imagemagick</pre>
<p>And then you can run two following commands to get nice and lightweight single PDF file generated from your .PNM files:</p>
<pre>convert out-000* concatenated.pdfgs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf concatenated.pdf</pre>
<p>I'm just wondering if anyone has some better or simpler way how to deal with these .pnm files and would like to share it in the comments?</p>

                <p>One of the worst thing which can happen to any developer is when the tool he uses 8+ hours per day suddenly changes the UI. This is the case of the new version of Eclipse on linux distributions - the GTK layout simply uses huge fonts and other elements so the whole workbench is just terribly useless. There is nothing simply you could do in the Eclipse settings for changing this behaviour but some smart guy came up with custom gtk theme which puts things back to order - so shutdown eclipse and do the following:</p>
<pre>vim ~/.gtkrc-2.0</pre>
<p>And put there:</p>
<pre>style "gtkcompact" {font_name="Sans 8"GtkButton::default_border={0,0,0,0}GtkButton::default_outside_border={0,0,0,0}GtkButtonBox::child_min_width=0GtkButtonBox::child_min_heigth=0GtkButtonBox::child_internal_pad_x=0GtkButtonBox::child_internal_pad_y=0GtkMenu::vertical-padding=1GtkMenuBar::internal_padding=0GtkMenuItem::horizontal_padding=4GtkToolbar::internal-padding=0GtkToolbar::space-size=0GtkOptionMenu::indicator_size=0GtkOptionMenu::indicator_spacing=0GtkPaned::handle_size=4GtkRange::trough_border=0GtkRange::stepper_spacing=0GtkScale::value_spacing=0GtkScrolledWindow::scrollbar_spacing=0GtkExpander::expander_size=10GtkExpander::expander_spacing=0GtkTreeView::vertical-separator=0GtkTreeView::horizontal-separator=0GtkTreeView::expander-size=8GtkTreeView::fixed-height-mode=TRUEGtkWidget::focus_padding=0}class "GtkWidget" style "gtkcompact"style "gtkcompactextra" {xthickness=0ythickness=0}class "GtkButton" style "gtkcompactextra"class "GtkToolbar" style "gtkcompactextra"class "GtkPaned" style "gtkcompactextra"</pre>

It MS Windows alternative would be <a title="Foobar2000" href="http://www.foobar2000.org/" target="_blank">foobar</a> which has pretty the same level of awesomeness as DeaDBeeF.. Unfortunately there is <a title="Deadbeef packages" href="https://launchpad.net/~alexey-smirnov/+archive/deadbeef">no official package</a> for new Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal. But thanks to <a href="http://notesalexp.org/" target="_blank">alternative user package repositories</a> you can very easy install the player through standard  Ubuntu way.</p>
<pre>$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alex-p/notesalexp-quantal<restore-line-break>$ sudo apt-get update<restore-line-break>$ sudo apt-get install deadbeef</pre>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I'm running Linux Mint on my desktop and I recently updated my eclipse version to new Juno. After that the Eclipse sometimes doesn't want to start and I end up with frozen tiny dialog without any content which I'm not able to close and have to kill it. The issue lies somewhere deep in preferences of your workspace when eclipse sometimes can't load your cached data. If something like this is happening to you as well try to check the log file of your current eclipse profile which you can find in YOUR_WORKSPACE/.metadata/.log - if you see some thing like the error below at the very bottom of this file then you are experiencing the same bug.</p>
<pre>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferenceConverter<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.themes.ThemeElementHelper.installFont(ThemeElementHelper.java:103)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.themes.ThemeElementHelper.populateRegistry(ThemeElementHelper.java:59)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench$27.runWithException(Workbench.java:1550)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.StartupThreading$StartupRunnable.run(StartupThreading.java:31)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.RunnableLock.run(RunnableLock.java:35)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Synchronizer.runAsyncMessages(Synchronizer.java:135)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runAsyncMessages(Display.java:3529)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Display.java:3182)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.runUI(Workbench.java:2478)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.access$7(Workbench.java:2386)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench$5.run(Workbench.java:583)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.Realm.runWithDefault(Realm.java:332)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench(Workbench.java:540)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(PlatformUI.java:149)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.application.IDEApplication.start(IDEApplication.java:124)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.equinox.internal.app.EclipseAppHandle.run(EclipseAppHandle.java:196)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.runApplication(EclipseAppLauncher.java:110)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.start(EclipseAppLauncher.java:79)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:353)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:180)<restore-line-break> at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)<restore-line-break> at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)<restore-line-break> at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)<restore-line-break> at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.invokeFramework(Main.java:629)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:584)<restore-line-break> at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:1438)</pre>
<p>
So how to get rid of this? First of all kill the eclipse if its still running with:</p>
<pre>ps -ax | grep eclipse<restore-line-break>kill $id</pre>
<p>
And then delete the file which is breaking Eclipse:</p>
<pre><code>rm YOUR_WORKSPACE/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.snap</code></pre>
<p>
That's it - enjoy coding!</p>

<div>As the error actually doesn't say what kind of temp directory is missing, it had to use the google and after a while I've found a fix. You can either disable the administration server which is intergated in ActiveMQ through Jetty or create two directories which is Jetty complaining about.</div>
<p>
<code> apache-activemq-5.5.0\bin\win32\temp\
apache-activemq-5.5.0\bin\win32\work\
</code></p>
<div>Enjoy!</div>

                    <p>The title of this post sound little bit silly as one would say what kind of issue could be in such straightforward process like installing drivers for my digital camera. Well - if you have original disc from Canon then you are fine. But in case you lost the disc or just bought used camera without original accessories then Canon prepared a terrible horror for you. The company has its application published on their web pages but there is one problem with it - the packages are called as "Updaters" and they can not be installed as standalone versions. You have to insert original CD from Canon prior to installing those updates and that's it. So if you lost your CD's, you have to contact Canon and re-buy copies of those (or get some friend and ask him for copies). Unbelievable, huh?</p>

<p>I was in the described situation today and after almost 2 hours swearing and searching on the internet I've found solution. The short version which was working for me on my 64bit Windows 7 is here:</p>
<ul>
	
<li>Create a new file on your drive called for example canon-installation.reg</li>
<li>Insert following content in it</li>
</ul>
<pre>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\EOS Utility]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\DPP]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\ZoomBrowser EX]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\ZoomBrowser EX\Settings]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\ZoomBrowser EX\Install]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\PhotoStitch]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\EOS Capture]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\EOSViewerUtility]<restore-line-break>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Canon\ODSK]</pre>
<ul>
	
<li>double click in the newly created file so its content will be saved into registry</li>
<li><a title="Download Canon software" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_digital_rebel#DriversAndSoftware">download</a> and run the updater from Canon again and it won't be asking for original CD anymore</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is more info in <a title="Install Canon camera software without CD" href="http://www.northlight-images.co.uk/article_pages/install_canon_software.html">Install Canon camera software without CD</a> post with different versions for different operational systems including Apple's mac.</p>

                    <p>Just few days ago I started getting <strong>authentication errors</strong> when trying to synchronize my PDA (HTC Artemis) with Google account. It had been working without any problems for few week, then suddenly stopped. I was trying to remove the server from active sync and re-add it, reboot both pda and laptop but nothing helped. I tried to search the internet and despite there is a lost of posts in forums asking for the same or similar problem (some of those related to Google service being down, some of those to other stuff)  there is no clear advice. Then I found out one post mentioning <strong>blocked captcha</strong> for google account and after few secs I was <strong>able to sync</strong> my phone with google again.</p>

                <p>Just few days ago I started getting <strong>authentication errors</strong> when trying to synchronize my PDA (HTC Artemis) with Google account. It had been working without any problems for few week, then suddenly stopped. I was trying to remove the server from active sync and re-add it, reboot both pda and laptop but nothing helped. I tried to search the internet and despite there is a lost of posts in forums asking for the same or similar problem (some of those related to Google service being down, some of those to other stuff)  there is no clear advice. Then I found out one post mentioning <strong>blocked captcha</strong> for google account and after few secs I was <strong>able to sync</strong> my phone with google again.</p>
After that I realized what actually happened. Some day I was trying to install Gmail client in my PDA and could not log into my account through it. It was still displaying index page with fields for user and password, after entering correct values it displayed error message stating that I entered bad username/password. I have tried it again for few times as I was pretty sure that credentials I am entering are correct - and then the client started to show also <strong>captcha field</strong> as usual. In that moment I gave up and close the client. I would never thought that this could be the reason for sync errors through the Exchange server, but it was! So what to do for fixing this? The solution si pretty easy but as usual, almost unknown to anyone.</p>
<p>Got to <a title="Google Captcha Unlock" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha?">Google Captcha </a><a title="Google Captcha Unlock" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha?">Unlock</a> page (you can use your computer for that, it doesn't need to be done through blocked PDA) , simply enter your username, password and captcha text. If everything is correct, the page display message that the account was unlocked and you can try to run sync.</p>

                <p>So are you getting mad after the <a title="Google Reader: Following, liking and people searching" href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/07/following-liking-and-people-searching.html">last socials</a> change made to Reader by Google and trying to find how to get rid of those annoying <em>how many people like this post</em>?<em> </em>If you are using Firefox based browser, here is the how to!</p>
<p>For hiding the socials stuff we will use CSS in something what is called user defined default styles. For Mozilla family browser you can defined special set of instructions which would modify user interface behaviour of your browser and also web pages. The instructions are stored in two separate files in user directory and names of the files are <em>userChrome.css</em> and <em>userContent.css</em> (you can read more about those on <a title="mozilla.org - Customizing Mozilla" href="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html">official Mozilla</a> web site). We will be interested in <em>userContent.css</em>, which is used for modifying default behaviour of websites you visit.</p>
<p>But first of all we need to find, where is this file stored. On Linux machines it should be in user home in .chrome directory (/home/username/.chrome). On Windows is the situation different with each version - for Windows XP is the best way to do <strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Run</strong> -&gt; type <strong>%APPDATA%</strong> and hit Enter. The folder with the application data will appear, go to Mozilla -&gt; Firefox -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Default profile directory -&gt; chrome. In here create a new file called userChrome.css and put there this content:</p>
<pre class="css">.entry-likers { display: none ! important; }</pre>
<p>
Try to reload Google Reader page to check if the annoying socials Like this anchors are still there - if so, restart the browser and enjoy socials free Reader!</p>
