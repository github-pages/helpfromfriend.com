It was made by Catalina Tomcat team as an additional task. The class is called <em>org.apache.catalina.ant.DeployTask</em> and is a part of the library <em>catalina-ant.jar</em>, which is distributed with tomcat package (you can find it in <em>$TOMCAT_HOME/server/lib/</em> directory).</p><p>Okay, that was it but now how to make the Eclipse to use it? The sollution is pretty easy and elegant. Go to <em>Preferences</em> (<em>Window &gt; Preferences</em>), click on <em>Ant</em> and highlight <em>Runtime</em>. On the first bookmark called <em>Classpath</em> we have to add the <em>catalina-ant.jar</em> library - so click on first entry called <em>Ant Home Entries</em> and on the right side choose <em>Add External JARs</em>.</p><p>Now you have two options - you can manually copy the <em>catalina-ant.jar</em> to your eclipse/ant directory (where are also the other ant libraries) or you can keep the library in your tomcat directory and from Eclipse just point to it. Since you can later move or rename the Tomcat directory and the build will stop working again until you will solve the changed path in Ant dependencies, I would prefer the first option.</p><p>Then still in runtime settings of Ant switch to second bookmark called <em>Tasks</em>, choose <em>Add Task</em> on the right side and enter your target name for deploy (in my case <em>deploy</em>) and the <em>catalina-ant.jar</em> library from the drop down list, which we have added in previous step.</p><p>And it is done! Just try to run the target again and you should see successful deploy action to your Tomcat server.</p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://github-pages.github.io/helpfromfriend.com/how-to-fix-the-startup-freeze-in-pspad.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">How to fix the startup freeze in PSPad</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://github-pages.github.io/helpfromfriend.com/how-to-use-and039lessand039-as-a-logging-tool.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">How to use &amp;#039;less&amp;#039; as a logging tool</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
